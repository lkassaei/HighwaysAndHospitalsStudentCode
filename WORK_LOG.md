| Sept. 12 | 2-2:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I first made sure to include the case where hospitals cost less than highways, and therefore it is cheapest to buy only hospitals. Then, I brainstormed how I might solve the problem, and landed on DFS to count the clusters of citites and then return hospitals times the number of clusters. |
| Sept. 13 | 8- 9:30pm | I started implementing DFS by created an array of booleans marking if the city at the index has been visited and going through all the cities. If a city has not been visited, I would perform DFS on its neighbors to mark them as visited and I added a cluster to my count. To find and mark all the neighbors of a city, I just checked if the current city had a possible connection to another city by checking cities[i][0] and cities[i][1] and if it did, I would mark the other city as visited and add it to the stack to eventually find all of its neighbors/connections. This worked for most of the test cases, but failed the large ones because it timed out, so I knew my code was not efficient enough. To fix this, I remembered our emphasis on graphs during class so I was sure that would be the solution and I set out to create that. |
| Sept. 13 |  9:30-10  |                   To make my code more efficient, I added a graph that is an array of Integer ArrayLists, that displays an ArrayList of all possible connections at the index of the city number. I re-did my DFS to use quick lookups from my graph, but when I ran it, the two largest test cases were still not correct. The good thing is that they were now not timing out, but just had wrong values, so my first instinct was that this was a rounding issue. Looking at the code that calculated the final cost, I noticed that I was first multiplying two integers to find the final hospital cost and final highway cost, and then casting those values to longs and adding them. I fixed this by casting the final highway and hospital costs to longs in the multiplication step, so that no integer truncation could occur. This fixed the issue! |
| Sept. 21 |  3-3:45   |                                                                                                 After learning about Union Find, I deleted my DFS approach and got started on a Union Find approach with path compression and weight balancing. After writing the logic to assign father roots based on the orders of the ultimate father roots of two trees, I struggled to write the function that actually found those father roots. At first I tried doing many comparisons, but did some research and figured out that recursion is the best way to solve this problem. That made a lot more sense in my head, so I was easily able to write a simple recursive method that stopped once it found a negative value (meaning that was the father root) and then just kept on looking with the parent of the current root while path compressing on the way. |
